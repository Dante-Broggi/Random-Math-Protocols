 Linear type systems (allow exchange, not weakening or contraction):
         Every variable is used exactly once.
         - moveonly
         - consuming / owned
         * explicit disposal
 Affine type systems (allow exchange and weakening, not contraction):
         Every variable is used at most once.
         - consuming / owned
 Relevant type systems (allow exchange and contraction, not weakening):
         Every variable is used at least once.
         - consuming / owned
         * explicit disposal
 Ordered type systems (discard exchange, contraction and weakening):
         Every variable is used exactly once in the order it was introduced.
